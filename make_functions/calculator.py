# Recommended: Make a 'functions' folder inside your PyCharm project for storing learning about functions.
#
# Create a Python file called calculator.py and complete a viable basic calculator using functions.
#
# MVP (each of these should be in a separate function):
#
# Can add 2 numbers
# Can subtract 2 numbers
# Can multiply 2 numbers
# Can divide 2 numbers
# Taking it to the next level:
#
# Implement more complex operations, such as handling parentheses, exponentiation
# More advanced operations should continue to be broken into separate functions
