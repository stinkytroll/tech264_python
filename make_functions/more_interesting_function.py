# 3. Make a more interesting version of a function that accepts one argument
# Here is the code to call the function:
# greet("Susan")
# You need to write the function
# Make sure the print statement in your function uses concatenation (ie. +) rather than an f-string
# Output should be:
# Hello, my name is Susan.

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, my name is " + name)


greet("Hello, my name is Susan")
