# 4. Make a function with 2 arguments that returns a value
# Troubleshoot this code so that the function returns the correct value of 4:
# This time we do NOT want the function to do the print to the screen
# Document what you've learnt

def addition(int1, int2):
    return int1 + int2


print(addition(2, 2))  # Since print is not inside the function, we need to use return above.
